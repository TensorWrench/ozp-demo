##IWC Client files
**Bower**: from your project's directory run `bower install ozone-development/ozp-iwc`

The IWC Client file you will reference from your application is at `bower_components/ozp-iwc/dist/js/ozpIwc-client.min.js`


***

**Manually**: grab the latest distribution of the IWC client from the [IWC git repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozone-development/ozp-iwc/master/dist/js/ozpIwc-client.min.js) and place it in your project's directory. (Location is arbitrary, just locatable from your html)

_NOTE: For the remainder of this guide the IWC client will be referenced from the bower installed location_
