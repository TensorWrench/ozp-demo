#IWC App Integration Guide
The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate how to add an IWC bus to a JavaScript application. This guide covers connecting to an externally hosted bus (a remote server is hosting the IWC components and connections to any database). 

For information on integrating the IWC with an angular application please see [IWC Angular App Integration](about:blank).

For information on hosting the IWC and an Ozone database please see [IWC Backend Integration](about:blank).
