# IWC Backend Integration Guide
The purpose of this guide is to demonstrate how to host the IWC and an Ozone database to be used by IWC applications. An deployable node.js example can be found [here](https://github.com/ozone-development/ozp-iwc-integrationDemo).

This guide covers:
 * gathering the IWC components to host
 * configuring the IWC for individual purpose
 * setting connections for the IWC to the Ozone database.

**This is not a guide for adding an IWC instance to an application**. For information on adding an IWC instance to an application please see [[IWC App Integration]].
